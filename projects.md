## Climate Changes and Loon Migration 

Over the past 30 years, data, and specifically citizen science data, has become readily available in large quantities. To investigate if Loons have changed wintering behaviors due to climate change in these past decades, this project makes use of the eBird platform run by Cornell University to analyze trends and compute measures of dispersion in an attempt to uncover shifts in wintering ranges over time. This is an ongoing project, but to date the data show a northernly increase in the highest portions of loons wintering range, while the median/mean remains relatively unchanged. 

## SET

A seemingly simple pattern-matching card game, SET in fact operates on a deep base of interesting and relevant mathematics, including combinatorics, linear algebra, affine geometries, and more. To uncover some of this behavior, a computation approach was taken to reveal the effects of various initial conditions, experiment with strategies, and discover rare scenarios over tens of millions of game iterations. Due to its versatility, this was done with an object oriented Python program making use of various libraries and techniques to produce, manipulate and analyze the large multidimensional arrays of data.
